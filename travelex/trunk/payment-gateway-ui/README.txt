1. Added everything from Flex Builder project excluding bin-debug 

2. Project not part of Maven build - must be built separately using Flex Builder. There are Maven plugins for compiling Flex apps but the don't have all of the features of the Flex Builder UI so will stick with ide until clearer on required features. Might switch later.

3. For the same reason as 2, their is a libs directory which contains the required 3rd party libs
