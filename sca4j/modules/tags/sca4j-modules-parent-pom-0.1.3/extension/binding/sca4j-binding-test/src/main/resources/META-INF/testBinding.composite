Implements a limited functionality binding for test purposes. The binding only supports invocations between clients and
providers in the same VM. Other limitations include no support for operator overloading and support for complex types
only if the client and provider share a common parent classloader.

To bind a service or reference, use the binding.test element with either uri to make the service available at or the
destination uri the reference should flow invocations to as in:

&gtbinding.test uri="MyService"&lt
