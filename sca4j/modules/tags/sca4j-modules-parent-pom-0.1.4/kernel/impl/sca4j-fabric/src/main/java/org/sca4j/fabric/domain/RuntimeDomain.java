/**
 * Implements a domain for system components in a runtime. SCA4J runtimes are constituted using SCA components and the runtime domain manages
 * deployment of those system components. When a runtime is booted, the runtime domain is provided with a set of primoridal services for deploying
 * system components. After bootstrap, the runtime domain is reinjected with a new set of fully-configured deployment services.
