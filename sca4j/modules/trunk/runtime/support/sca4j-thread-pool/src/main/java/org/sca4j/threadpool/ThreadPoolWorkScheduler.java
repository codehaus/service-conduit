 * Apache Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
 * Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is
 * required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
 * the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
 * in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
 * status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
 * code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
