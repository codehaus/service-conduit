    Apache Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
    Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is
    required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
    the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
    in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
    status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
    code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

    This product includes software developed by
    The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).
