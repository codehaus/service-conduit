 * Apache Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
 * Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is
 * required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
 * the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
 * in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
 * status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
 * code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

/**
 * Context for gathering the results of model validation.
 * <p/>
 * The context allows both errors and warnings to be gathered. Errors indicate problems that will definitely prevent the model object from being
 * activated such as a missing implementation. Warnings indicate issues that are not in themselves fatal but which may result in an activation
 * failure. For example, a composite service may promote a component that it does not contain. This is likely to be an error but would successfully
 * activate if the component was defined by another composite that included this one.
